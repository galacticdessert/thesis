abstract = {This project studied the pool boiling of R-134a and R-123 on smooth and enhanced tubes. This is the 1st phase of ASHRAE project RP-1316 “Experimental Evaluation of The Heat Transfer Impacts of Tube Pitch in a Highly Enhanced Surface Tube Bundle”. A Turbo BII-HP and a Turbo BII-LP enhanced tubes were used in this study. These tubes were manufactured and donated by Wolverine Tube, Inc. Four different boiling cases were tested, R-134a on smooth tube, R-123 on smooth tube, R-134a on Turbo BII-HP tube, and R-123 on Turbo BII-LP tube. The first step in this study was performing a modified Wilson plot analysis, once completed, the average and local refrigerant heat transfer coefficients were determined. This thesis also presents the enthalpy-based heat transfer analysis (EBHT), a new method for determining the heat exchanger's overall heat transfer coefficient as a function of the enthalpy change of incompressible fluids. The test tubes' outer diameter is 19.05 mm and length is 1 m. Tests were conducted in a single tube test section, in which the test tube was water heated. All tests were conducted at a saturation temperature of 4.44 °C. The heat flux range is 9.2-126.6 kW/m² for testing with R- 134a on smooth tube, 9.2-58 kW/m² for R-123 on smooth tube, 4.1-135.1 kW/m² for R-134a on Turbo BII-HP tube and 4.7-59.8 kW/m² for R-123 on Turbo BII-LP tube. Results show that the heat transfer coefficient increases with heat flux for all cases except the case of R-134a on Turbo BII-HP tube, where it experiences a trend change. Part of this study was comparing the smooth and enhanced tubes performances. R-134a Turbo BII-HP tube to smooth tube heat transfer coefficient ratio changes from 4 at low heat flux to 1.7 at high heat flux. R-123 Turbo BII-LP tube to smooth tube heat transfer coefficient ratio changes from 24 at low heat flux to 7 at high heat flux. The performance of Turbo BII-HP and Turbo BII-LP was found to be very similar over the tested heat flux range of the Turbo BII-LP tube. Comparison plots with available literature are presented.},

abstract = {The current paper presents experimental investigation of nucleate pool boiling of R-134a and R-123 on enhanced and smooth tubes. The enhanced tubes used were TBIIHP and TBIILP for R-134a and R-123, respectively. Pool boiling data were taken for smooth and enhanced tubes in a single tube test section. Data were taken at a saturation temperature of 4.44 ??C. Each test tube had an outside diameter of 19.05 mm and a length of 1 m. The test section was water heated with an insert in the water passage. The insert allowed measurement of local water temperatures down the length of the test tube. Utilizing this instrumentation, local heat transfer coefficients were determined at five locations along the test tube. The heat flux range was 2.5-157.5 kW/m 2 for the TBIIHP tube and 3.1-73.2 kW/m 2 for the TBIILP tube. The resulting heat transfer coefficient range was 4146-23255 W/m 2.??C and 5331-25950 W/m 2.??C for both tubes, respectively. For smooth tube testing, the heat flux ranges were 7.3-130.7 kW/m 2 and 7.5-60.7 kW/m 2 for R-134a and R-123, respectively; with resulting heat transfer coefficient ranges of 1798.9-11,379 W/m 2.??C and 535.4-3181.8 W/m 2.??C. The study provided one of the widest heat flux ranges ever examined for these types of tubes and showed significant structure to the pool boiling curve that had not been traditionally observed. Additionally, this paper presented an investigation of enhanced tubes pool boiling models. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Rankine bottoming system, which operates on waste heat of engine cooling, has been developped to improve the fuel economy of a passenger car. Evaporative engine cooling system is utilized to obtain high thermal efficiency and simplicity of the Rankine bottoming system. The bottoming system uses HCFC123 as a working fluid, and scroll expander as a power conversion unit. The results indicate that energy recovery, which depends on the ambient temperature, is almost 3 percent of engine output power at ambient temperature of 25°C.},
