abstract = {To achieve a step improvement in engine efficiency, a novel split cycle engine concept is proposed. The engine has separate compression and combustion cylinders and waste heat is recovered between the two. Quasi-isothermal compression of the charge air is realised in the compression cylinder while isobaric combustion of the air/fuel mixture is achieved in the combustion cylinder. Exhaust heat recovery between the compression and combustion chamber enables highly efficient recovery of waste heat within the cycle. Based on cycle analysis and a one-dimensional engine model, the fundamentals and the performance of the split thermodynamic cycle is estimated. Compared to conventional engines, the compression work can be significantly reduced through the injection of a controlled quantity of water in the compression cylinder, lowering the gas temperature during compression. Thermal energy can then be effectively recovered from the engine exhaust in a recuperator between the cooled compressor cylinder discharge air and the exhaust gas. The resulting hot high pressure air is then injected into a combustor cylinder and mixed with fuel, where near isobaric combustion leads to a low combustion temperature and reduced heat transferred from the cylinder wall. Detailed cycle simulation indicates a 32{\%} efficiency improvement can be expected compared to the conventional diesel engines.},

abstract = {A novel concept for a high efficiency reciprocating internal combustion engine (the isoengine) is described and its cycle is analysed. The highly turbocharged engine configuration, which is intended primarily for on-site and distributed power generation, has a predicted electrical output of 7.3 MW. It has the option for co-generation of up to 3.2 MW of hot water at 95??C supply temperature. The maximum net electrical plant efficiency is predicted to be about 60{\%} on diesel fuel and 58{\%} on natural gas. The key to the high electrical efficiency is the quasi-isothermal compression of the combustion air in cylinders, which are separate from the power cylinders. This achieves a significant saving in compression work and allows the recovery of waste heat back into the cycle, mainly from the exhaust gas by means of a recuperator. The construction of a first 3 MWe prototype isoengine has been completed and its testing has begun. Relevant test results are expected in the near future. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A novel intra-cycle waste heat recovery (ICWHR) methodology, applied to an internal combustion engine is presented in this study. Through a split type thermodynamic cycle design, quasi-isothermal compres- sion of the charge air and isobaric combustion of the air/fuel mixture can be performed separately in two chambers. Within such a design, the exhaust heat can be recovered to the intake air flow between the compression chamber and combustion chamber. Consequently, the recovered energy can be re-utilized in the combustor directly, and an intra-cycle waste heat recovery process can be achieved. To investigate the fundamental aspects of this new methodology, a comparative study between the conventional Rankine based WHR and the new ICWHR was undertaken. Both theoretical and numerical analysis were applied to evaluate the performance characteristics of these two technologies. The ICWHR cycle differs from the Rankine cycle in that an energy conversion subsystem is not necessary since the recovered energy is sent back to the combustion chamber directly, and then the system efficiency is improved sig- nificantly. Furthermore, the theoretical results indicate that the full cycle efficiency of ICWHR system is determined by the regeneration effectiveness, the compression ratio and the fuel equivalence ratio, then the limitations of Rankine cycle, such as working fluid selection and system parameter calibration can be avoided mechanically. Finally, through a one dimensional system model, analysis of optimal operation range, system efficiency and the heat transfer behaviours of ICWHR system are discussed in this paper and comparisons made with a Rankine cycle WHR system. ?2016},
