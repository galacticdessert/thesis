@article{Dong2015,
abstract = {To achieve a step improvement in engine efficiency, a novel split cycle engine concept is proposed. The engine has separate compression and combustion cylinders and waste heat is recovered between the two. Quasi-isothermal compression of the charge air is realised in the compression cylinder while isobaric combustion of the air/fuel mixture is achieved in the combustion cylinder. Exhaust heat recovery between the compression and combustion chamber enables highly efficient recovery of waste heat within the cycle. Based on cycle analysis and a one-dimensional engine model, the fundamentals and the performance of the split thermodynamic cycle is estimated. Compared to conventional engines, the compression work can be significantly reduced through the injection of a controlled quantity of water in the compression cylinder, lowering the gas temperature during compression. Thermal energy can then be effectively recovered from the engine exhaust in a recuperator between the cooled compressor cylinder discharge air and the exhaust gas. The resulting hot high pressure air is then injected into a combustor cylinder and mixed with fuel, where near isobaric combustion leads to a low combustion temperature and reduced heat transferred from the cylinder wall. Detailed cycle simulation indicates a 32{\%} efficiency improvement can be expected compared to the conventional diesel engines.},

abstract = {The Scuderi engine is a split cycle design that divides the four strokes of a conventional combustion cycle over two paired cylinders, one intake/compression cylinder and one power/exhaust cylinder, connected by a crossover port. This configuration provides potential benefits to the combustion process, as well as presenting some challenges. It also creates the possibility for pneumatic hybridization of the engine. This paper reviews the first Scuderi split cycle research engine, giving an overview of its architecture and operation. It describes how the splitting of gas compression and combustion into two separate cylinders has been simulated and how the results were used to drive the engine architecture together with the design of the main engine systems for air handling, fuel injection, mixing and ignition. A prototype engine was designed, manufactured, and installed in a test cell. The engine was heavily instrumented and initial performance results are presented. {\textcopyright} 2011 SAE International.},

@article{Morgan2016,
abstract = {A novel intra-cycle waste heat recovery (ICWHR) methodology, applied to an internal combustion engine is presented in this study. Through a split type thermodynamic cycle design, quasi-isothermal compres- sion of the charge air and isobaric combustion of the air/fuel mixture can be performed separately in two chambers. Within such a design, the exhaust heat can be recovered to the intake air flow between the compression chamber and combustion chamber. Consequently, the recovered energy can be re-utilized in the combustor directly, and an intra-cycle waste heat recovery process can be achieved. To investigate the fundamental aspects of this new methodology, a comparative study between the conventional Rankine based WHR and the new ICWHR was undertaken. Both theoretical and numerical analysis were applied to evaluate the performance characteristics of these two technologies. The ICWHR cycle differs from the Rankine cycle in that an energy conversion subsystem is not necessary since the recovered energy is sent back to the combustion chamber directly, and then the system efficiency is improved sig- nificantly. Furthermore, the theoretical results indicate that the full cycle efficiency of ICWHR system is determined by the regeneration effectiveness, the compression ratio and the fuel equivalence ratio, then the limitations of Rankine cycle, such as working fluid selection and system parameter calibration can be avoided mechanically. Finally, through a one dimensional system model, analysis of optimal operation range, system efficiency and the heat transfer behaviours of ICWHR system are discussed in this paper and comparisons made with a Rankine cycle WHR system. ?2016},

@article{Coney2004,
abstract = {A novel concept for a high efficiency reciprocating internal combustion engine (the isoengine) is described and its cycle is analysed. The highly turbocharged engine configuration, which is intended primarily for on-site and distributed power generation, has a predicted electrical output of 7.3 MW. It has the option for co-generation of up to 3.2 MW of hot water at 95??C supply temperature. The maximum net electrical plant efficiency is predicted to be about 60{\%} on diesel fuel and 58{\%} on natural gas. The key to the high electrical efficiency is the quasi-isothermal compression of the combustion air in cylinders, which are separate from the power cylinders. This achieves a significant saving in compression work and allows the recovery of waste heat back into the cycle, mainly from the exhaust gas by means of a recuperator. The construction of a first 3 MWe prototype isoengine has been completed and its testing has begun. Relevant test results are expected in the near future. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The Scuderi engine is a split cycle design that divides the four strokes of a conventional combustion cycle over two paired cylinders, one intake/compression cylinder and one power/exhaust cylinder, connected by a crossover port. This configuration provides potential benefits to the combustion process, as well as presenting some challenges; it also creates the possibility for pneumatic hybridization of the engine. This paper presents the methodology and results of a comprehensive study to investigate the benefits of air hybrid operation with the Scuderi Split Cycle (SSC) engine. Four air hybrid operating modes are made possible by the Split Cycle configuration, namely air compressor, air expander, air expander {\&} firing and firing {\&} charging. The predicted operating requirements for each individual operating mode are established. The air and fuel flow of the individual modes are fully mapped throughout the engine operating speed and load range and air tank pressure operating range. With the requirements for engine speed and torque derived from a specified drive cycle, the optimum hybrid operating mode at each point is selected to minimize the overall drive cycle fuel consumption. The influence of air storage tank insulation on the vehicle fuel economy is briefly studied. The resulting fuel consumption is compared with that from a non-hybrid SSC powered vehicle to demonstrate the benefits of the pneumatic hybrid architecture.
