To this end, both a RC thermodynamic model and a heat exchanger model have been developed. Both models use as input, experimental data obtained from a vehicle tested on a chassis dynamometer. The thermodynamic analysis was performed for water, R123 and R245fa and revealed the advantage of using water as the working fluid in applications of thermal recovery from exhaust gases of vehicles equipped with a spark-ignition engine. Moreover, the heat exchanger effectiveness for the organic working fluids R123 and R245fa is higher than that for the water and, consequently, they can also be considered appropriate for use in vehicle WHR applications through RCs when the exhaust gas temperatures are relatively low. For an ideal heat exchanger, the simulations revealed increases in the internal combustion engine thermal and vehicle mechanical efficiencies of 1.4{\%}e3.52{\%} and 10.16{\%}e15.95{\%}, respectively, while for a shell and tube heat exchanger, the simulations showed an increase of 0.85{\%}e1.2{\%} in the thermal efficiency and an increase of 2.64{\%}e6.96{\%} in the mechanical efficiency for an evaporating pressure of 2 MPa. The results confirm the advantages of using the thermal energy contained in the vehicle exhaust gases through RCs. Furthermore, the present analysis demonstrates that improved evaporator designs and appropriate expander devices allowing for higher evaporating pressures are required to obtain the maximum WHR potential from vehicle RC systems.},

abstract = {The focus of this study is to review the latest developments and technologies on waste heat recovery of exhaust gas from internal combustion engines (ICE). These include thermoelectric generators (TEG), organic Rankine cycle (ORC), six-stroke cycle IC engine and new developments on turbocharger technology. Furthermore, the study looked into the potential energy savings and performances of those technologies. The current worldwide trend of increasing energy demand in transportation sector are one of the many segments that is responsible for the growing share of fossil fuel usage and indirectly contribute to the release of harmful greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. It is hoped that with the latest findings on exhaust heat recovery to increase the efficiency of ICEs, world energy demand on the depleting fossil fuel reserves would be reduced and hence the impact of global warming due to the GHG emissions would fade away. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {An organic Rankine cycle (ORC) machine is similar to a conventional steam cycle energy conversion system, but uses an organic fluid such as refrigerants and hydrocarbons instead of water. In recent years, research was intensified on this device as it is being progressively adopted as premier technology to convert low-temperature heat resources into power. Available heat resources are: solar energy, geothermal energy, biomass products, surface seawater, and waste heat from various thermal processes. This paper presents existing applications and analyzes their maturity. Binary geothermal and binary biomass CHP are already mature. Provided the interest to recover waste heat rejected by thermal devices and industrial processes continue to grow, and favorable legislative conditions are adopted, waste heat recovery organic Rankine cycle systems in the near future will experience a rapid growth. Solar modular power plants are being intensely investigated at smaller scale for cogeneration applications in buildings but larger plants are also expected in tropical or Sahel regions with constant and low solar radiation intensity. OTEC power plants operating mainly on offshore installations at very low temperature have been advertised as total resource systems and interest on this technology is growing in large isolated islands. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {a b s t r a c t In this paper, we present a steady-state experiment, energy balance and exergy analysis of exhaust gas in order to improve the recovery of the waste heat of an internal combustion engine (ICE). Considering the different characteristics of the waste heat of exhaust gas, cooling water, and lubricant, a combined thermodynamic cycle for waste heat recovery of ICE is proposed. This combined thermodynamic cycle consists of two cycles: the organic Rankine cycle (ORC), for recovering the waste heat of lubricant and high-temperature exhaust gas, and the Kalina cycle, for recovering the waste heat of low-temperature cooling water. Based on PengeRobinson (PR) equation of state (EOS), the thermodynamic parameters in the high-temperature ORC were calculated and determined via an in-house computer program. Suitable working fluids used in high-temperature ORC are proposed and the performance of this combined thermodynamic cycle is analyzed. Compared with the traditional cycle configuration, more waste heat can be recovered by the combined cycle introduced in this paper.},

abstract = {In internal combustion engines, only a part of the fuel energy flow is transformed into power available at the crankshaft, while the most part of the fuel energy flow is lost as coolant, exhaust gases and other waste heat flows. Recovery of waste heat from the exhaust gases, and the coolant with organic Rankine cycles (ORC) is considered here for a hybrid vehicle powered by a 1.8 L naturally aspirated gasoline engine. The ORC systems fitted on the exhaust and the coolant permit an increase in fuel conversion efficiency by up to 6.4{\%} and 2.8{\%} individually, and by up to 8.2{\%} combined. The average improvements all over the map are 3.4{\%}, 1.7{\%} and 5.1{\%} respectively. These gross improvements do not account for the less than uniform efficiency of the mechanical-to-electric-to- chemical-to-electric-to-mechanical loop when the ORC expanders are used to charge the battery of the hybrid vehicle. Nor do they account for the reduced efficiency of the thermal engine due to the back pressure effects on the indicated mean effective pressure (exhaust ORC) and friction mean effective pressure (coolant ORC). Nevertheless, these values serve as a reference point for the assessment of the current potential of a technology that is still being developed having major downfalls in the increase of weight, costs, packaging complexity and finally in difficulty in transient operation. ?? 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Horsta,
abstract = {a b s t r a c t Waste heat recovery (WHR) by means of a Rankine Cycle is a promising approach for achieving reduc-tions in fuel consumption and, as a result, exhaust emissions of passenger car engines. To find the best compromise between complexity and fuel saving potential, methods for predicting the WHR perfor-mance for different system configurations and stationary as well as dynamic driving scenarios are needed. Since WHR systems are usually not included in today's car concepts, they are mostly designed as add-on systems. As a result their integration may lead to negative interactions due to increased vehicle weight, engine backpressure and cooling demand. These effects have to be considered when evaluating the fuel saving potential. A new approach for predicting WHR performance and fuel saving potential was developed and is presented in this paper. It is based on simple dynamic models of a system for recovering exhaust gas waste heat and its interfaces with the vehicle: the exhaust system for heat input, the on-board electric system for power delivery and the engine cooling system for heat rejection. The models are validated with test bench measurements of the cycle components. A study of fuel saving potential in an exemplary dynamic motorway driving scenario shows the effect of vehicle integration: while the WHR system could improve fuel economy by 3.4{\%}, restrictions in power output due to the architecture of the on-board electric system, package considerations, increased weight, cooling demand and exhaust gas backpressure lead to a reduction of fuel saving potential by 60{\%} to 1.3{\%}. A parameter study reveals that, in addition to weight reduction and efficiency optimization, combining the WHR system with enhanced electrification of engine peripherals is the most effective approach to improve fuel saving potential. When assuming an increase in power demand of the on-board electric sys-tem from 750 to 1500 W, a fuel saving potential of 4{\%} – referring to a 3.6{\%} higher reference fuel consump-tion – is reached. WHR could therefore play an important role to overcome the challenges of increased electric power demand in future vehicles.},

abstract = {Internal combustion (IC) engines are the major source of motive power in the world, a fact that is expected to continue well into this century. To increase the total efficiency and reduce CO2 emissions, recently exhaust heat recovery (EHR) based on thermoelectric (TE) and thermal fluid systems have been explored widely and a number of new technologies have been developed in the past decade. In this paper, relevant researches are reviewed for providing an insight into possible system designs, thermodynamic principles to achieve high efficiency, and selection of working fluids to maintain necessary system performance. From a number of researches, it has been found the Rankine cycle (RC) has been the most favourite basic working cycle for thermodynamic EHR systems. Based on the cycle, various different system configurations have been investigated. Accepting a certain design and manufacture cost, a system based on heavy duty vehicle application can increase the total powertrain efficiency by up to 30{\%} (based on NEDC driving condition). To achieve the highest possible system efficiency, design of systemic structure and selections for both the expander and the working fluid (medium) are critical. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Prior papers have shown the potentials of gasoline-like internal combustion engines fitted with Rankine cycle systems to deliver Diesel-like steady state fuel conversion efficiencies recovering the exhaust and the coolant waste heat with off-the-shelf components. In addition to the pros of the technology significantly increasing steady state efficiencies – up to 5{\%} in absolute values and much more in relative values – these papers also mentioned the cons of the technology, increased backpressures, increased weight, more complex packaging, more complex control, troublesome transient operation, and finally the cold start issues that prevent the uptake of the technology. This paper further explores the option to use Rankine cycle systems to improve the fuel economy of vehicles under normal driving conditions. A single Rankine cycle system is integrated here with the engine design. A latest turbocharged 1.6 L direct injection engine has the coolant circuit modified to serve as pre-heater for the Rankine cycle fluid. This fluid is then vaporised and superheated in the boiler/superheater coaxial to the exhaust pipe located downstream of the turbocharger turbine and the closed coupled catalytic converter. The exhaust ports are insulated to reduce the heat losses. The pump of the Rankine cycle system is electrically operated. The expander of the Rankine cycle system drives a generator to recharge the traction battery pack. The thermal engine is connected to the transmission through an electric clutch and a motor/generator that permits to supplement/replace the thermal engine energy supply, recover the braking energy and start/stop the thermal engine. The integrated Rankine cycle system is intended to permit short warming-up profiles, reduced heat losses and reduced weight and packaging issues, delivering significant benefits during cold start driving cycles as the NEDC in addition to the long term, constant load and speed extra urban driving.},
