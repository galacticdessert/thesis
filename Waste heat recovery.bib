abstract = {Modern diesel engines used in light-duty transportation applications have peak brake thermal efficiencies in the range of 40-42{\%} for high-load operation with substantially lower efficiencies at realistic road-load conditions. Thermodynamic energy and exergy analysis reveals that the largest losses from these engines are due to combustion irreversibility and heat loss to the coolant, through the exhaust, and by direct convection and radiation to the environment. Substantial improvement in overall engine efficiency requires reducing or recovering these losses. Unfortunately, much of the heat transfer either occurs at relatively low temperatures resulting in large entropy generation (such as in the air-charge cooler), is transferred to low-exergy flow streams (such as the oil and engine coolant), or is radiated or convected directly to the environment. While there are significant opportunities for recovery from the exhaust and EGR cooler for heavy-duty applications, achieving similar benefits for light-duty diesel applications is complicated by transient, low-load operation at typical driving conditions and competition with the turbocharger and aftertreatment system for the limited thermal resources. We have developed an organic Rankine cycle (ORC) model using GT-Suite{\textregistered} to investigate the potential for efficiency improvement through waste-heat recovery from the exhaust and EGR cooler of a light-duty diesel engine. The model is used to examine the effects of efficiency-improvement strategies such as cylinder deactivation, use of advanced materials and improved insulation to limit ambient heat loss, and turbo-compounding on the steady-state performance of the ORC system and the availability of thermal energy for downstream aftertreatment systems. Results from transient drive-cycle simulations are also presented, and we discuss strategies to address operational difficulties associated with transient drive cycles and balancing the thermal requirements of waste-heat recovery, turbocharging or turbo-compounding, and exhaust aftertreatment.},

abstract = {The idea of thermal energy recovery from vehicle engine exhaust flow is now well supported and funded. Through a number of research projects, several component technologies have been identified. Rankine cycle, turbo-compounding and thermo-electric systems have all attracted interest. Fuel economy improvements vary depending on the drive cycle and the capability of the underlying technologies, but have been reported as high as 25{\%}.Our work at Sussex on a form of Rankine cycle has revealed generic issues about the control of thermal recovery and the associated modelling requirements. Typical issues include the balancing the rate of heat input to the recovery system with the loss of useful work from large temperature differences. The size of components dictates the control authority over the system and consequently its ability to follow changing conditions.In this paper we take a broad look at the control issues and use illustrations from both our experience with vapour based systems and published results. We will propose control architectures that match the particular characteristics of the component technologies. We comment on control issues and how the choice of system architecture influences both the timing and amount of work production from recovery systems.},

abstract = {The Scuderi engine is a split cycle design that divides the four strokes of a conventional combustion cycle over two paired cylinders, one intake/compression cylinder and one power/exhaust cylinder, connected by a crossover port. This configuration provides potential benefits to the combustion process, as well as presenting some challenges; it also creates the possibility for pneumatic hybridization of the engine. This paper presents the methodology and results of a comprehensive study to investigate the benefits of air hybrid operation with the Scuderi Split Cycle (SSC) engine. Four air hybrid operating modes are made possible by the Split Cycle configuration, namely air compressor, air expander, air expander {\&} firing and firing {\&} charging. The predicted operating requirements for each individual operating mode are established. The air and fuel flow of the individual modes are fully mapped throughout the engine operating speed and load range and air tank pressure operating range. With the requirements for engine speed and torque derived from a specified drive cycle, the optimum hybrid operating mode at each point is selected to minimize the overall drive cycle fuel consumption. The influence of air storage tank insulation on the vehicle fuel economy is briefly studied. The resulting fuel consumption is compared with that from a non-hybrid SSC powered vehicle to demonstrate the benefits of the pneumatic hybrid architecture.

The thermodynamic performances of an ORC system under disturbances have been analyzed. The results show: maximizing the usage of exhaust heat as much as possible is a good way to improve system output net power and efficiency; the degree of sub-cooling at the condenser outlet should be small (0.5-0.6 K); when the ambient temperature is too high, the system output net power and efficiency will deteriorate with the departure from nominal state possibly exceeding 30{\%}. According to the running environment, choosing a proper nominal state is a good idea for improving the system output net power and efficiency. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Two combined cogeneration cycles are examined in which the waste heat from a recompression supercritical CO2 Brayton cycle (sCO2) is recovered by either a transcritical CO2 cycle (tCO2) or an Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) for generating electricity. An exergoeconomic analysis is performed for sCO2/tCO2 cycle performance and its comparison to the sCO2/ORC cycle. The following organic fluids are considered as the working fluids in the ORC: R123, R245fa, toluene, isobutane, isopentane and cyclohexane. Thermodynamic and exergoeconomic models are developed for the cycles on the basis of mass and energy conservations, exergy balance and exergy cost equations. Parametric investigations are conducted to evaluate the influence of decision variables on the performance of sCO2/tCO2 and sCO2/ORC cycles. The performance of these cycles is optimized and then compared. The results show that the sCO2/tCO2 cycle is preferable and performs better than the sCO2/ORC cycle at lower PRc. When the sCO2 cycle operates at a cycle maximum pressure of around 20 MPa ({\~{}}2.8 of PRc), the tCO2 cycle is preferable to be integrated with the recompression sCO2 cycle considering the off-design conditions. Moreover, contrary to the sCO2/ORC system, a higher tCO2 turbine inlet temperature improves exergoeconomic performance of the sCO2/tCO2 cycle. The thermodynamic optimization study reveals that the sCO2/tCO2 cycle has comparable second law efficiency with the sCO2/ORC cycle. When the optimization is conducted based on the exergoeconomics, the total product unit cost of the sCO2/ORC is slightly lower than that of the sCO2/tCO2 cycle.},

abstract = {Exhaust heat from diesel engines can be an important heat source to provide additional power using a separate Rankine Cycle (RC). In this research, experiments were conducted to measure the available exhaust heat from a 40 kW diesel generator using two 'off-the-shelf' heat exchangers. The effectiveness of the heat exchangers using water as the working fluid was found to be 0.44 which seems to be lower than a standard one. This lower performance of the existing heat exchangers indicates the necessity of optimization of the design of the heat exchangers for this particular application. With the available experimental data, computer simulations were carried out to optimize the design of the heat exchangers. Two heat exchangers were used to generate super-heated steam to expand in the turbine using two orientations: series and parallel. The optimized heat exchangers were then used to estimate additional power considering actual turbine isentropic efficiency. The proposed heat exchanger was able to produce 11{\%} additional power using water as the working fluid at a pressure of 15 bar at rated engine load. This additional power resulted into 12{\%} improvement in brake-specific fuel consumption (bsfc). The effects of the working fluid pressure were also investigated to maximize the additional power production. The pressure was limited to 15 bar which was constrained by the exhaust gas temperature. However, higher pressure is possible for higher exhaust gas temperatures from higher capacity engines. This would yield more additional power with further improvements in bsfc. At 40{\%} part load, the additional power developed was 3.4{\%} which resulted in 3.3{\%} reduction in bsfc. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Engine Cooling losses constitutes about 20{\%} of the injected fuel energy in a mod- ern heavy duty truck diesel engine. The objective of this Master Thesis Project is to investigate flow boiling cooling as a thermally efficient method for waste heat recovery as well as a good solution for precision cooling. First, an engine heat transfer model was implemented on GT-suite software in or- der to estimate heat fluxes within the engine cylinder. Liners being less thermally constrained than the cylinder head, flow boiling cooling was then investigated in the liner's water jackets. A more adapted heat transfer model taking into account both gas side and cooling side of the liner was thus implemented on Simulink. Unlike commercials software, this simple model allowed to implement the relevant two-phase heat transfer correlations and to study in details the boiling flow behav- iors. The hydraulic diameter of the water jackets, the fluid saturated pressure and the surface area of heat transfer are the major parameters and they were studied for various mass flow rate in order to analyze how they influence wall temperature and heat transfer. This study showed good operating conditions for very low mass flow rate (about 1{\%} of the typical mass flow rate for liquid convective cooling). Due to flow control issues, it implied the consideration of other fluids such as refrigerants but showed good prospect for cooling system simplification. This flow boiling model was final inserted in a complete Rankine loop model using water as a working fluid to study potential efficiency improvements. A Rankine loop using water as a working fluid would thus improve the heat recovery of the considered engine of about 4.8{\%} of the net engine brake power, recovering heat from the liners and the exhaust gases at 1800RPM, full load. Further simulations have also been led with R245fa, which shows a WHR of about 5.5{\%} of the net engine brake power at 1800RPM, full load.},

abstract = {Many studies have been published on the performance and optimisation of the Brayton cycle and solar thermal Brayton cycle showing the potential, merits and challenges of this technology. Solar thermal Brayton systems have potential to be used as power plants in many sun-drenched countries. It can be very competitive in terms of efficiency, cost and environmental impact. When designing a system such as a recuperative Brayton cycle there is always a compromise between allowing effective heat transfer and keeping pressure losses in components small. The high temperatures required in especially the receiver of the system present a challenge in terms of irreversibilities due to heat loss. In this paper, the authors recommend the use of the total entropy generation minimisation method. This method can be applied for the modelling of a system and can serve as validation when compared with first-law modelling. The authors review various modelling perspectives required to develop an objective function for solar thermal power optimisation, including modelling of the sun as an exergy source, the Gouy-Stodola theorem and turbine modelling. With recommendations, the authors of this paper wish to clarify and simplify the optimisation and modelling of the solar thermal Brayton cycle for future work. The work is applicable to solar thermal studies in general but focuses on the small-scale recuperated solar thermal Brayton cycle. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

To increase the total efficiency and reduce CO2 emissions, recently exhaust heat recovery (EHR) based on thermoelectric (TE) and thermal fluid systems have been explored widely and a number of new technologies have been developed in the past decade. In this paper, relevant researches are reviewed for providing an insight into possible system designs, thermodynamic principles to achieve high efficiency, and selection of working fluids to maintain necessary system performance. From a number of researches, it has been found the Rankine cycle (RC) has been the most favourite basic working cycle for thermodynamic EHR systems. Based on the cycle, various different system configurations have been investigated. Accepting a certain design and manufacture cost, a system based on heavy duty vehicle application can increase the total powertrain efficiency by up to 30{\%} (based on NEDC driving condition). To achieve the highest possible system efficiency, design of systemic structure and selections for both the expander and the working fluid (medium) are critical. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper illustrates the design of a practical supervision and control system for a pilot Rankine steam process for exhaust gas heat recovery from a spark-ignition engine. The proposed control strategy for power production focuses more on ensuring continuity of operation than on the pursuit of optimality. The resulting decentralized control system is implemented via two anti-wind up controllers with feedforward action. Performance has been assessed in simulation on a motorway driving cycle using real engine exhaust data. Despite very transient exhaust gas conditions, we show that the expander can produce power throughout the cycle, avoiding start-stop procedures, which would greatly reduce the global efficiency.},

abstract = {In this work, low temperature Organic Rankine Cycles are studied as bottoming cycle in medium and large scale combined cycle power plants. The analysis aims to show the interest of using these alternative cycles with high efficiency heavy duty gas turbines, for example recuperative gas turbines with lower gas turbine exhaust temperatures than in conventional combined cycle gas turbines. The following organic fluids have been considered: R113, R245, isobutene, toluene, cyclohexane and isopentane. Competitive results have been obtained for toluene and cyclohexane ORC combined cycles, with reasonably high global efficiencies. The paper is structured in four main parts. A review of combined cycle and ORC cycle technologies is presented, followed by a thermodynamic analysis of combined cycles with commercial gas turbines and ORC low temperature bottoming cycles. Then, a parametric optimization of an ORC combined cycle plant is performed in order to achieve a better integration between these two technologies. Finally, some economic considerations related to the use of ORC in combined cycles are discussed. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In internal combustion engines, only a part of the fuel energy flow is transformed into power available at the crankshaft, while the most part of the fuel energy flow is lost as coolant, exhaust gases and other waste heat flows. Recovery of waste heat from the exhaust gases, and the coolant with organic Rankine cycles (ORC) is considered here for a hybrid vehicle powered by a 1.8 L naturally aspirated gasoline engine. The ORC systems fitted on the exhaust and the coolant permit an increase in fuel conversion efficiency by up to 6.4{\%} and 2.8{\%} individually, and by up to 8.2{\%} combined. The average improvements all over the map are 3.4{\%}, 1.7{\%} and 5.1{\%} respectively. These gross improvements do not account for the less than uniform efficiency of the mechanical-to-electric-to- chemical-to-electric-to-mechanical loop when the ORC expanders are used to charge the battery of the hybrid vehicle. Nor do they account for the reduced efficiency of the thermal engine due to the back pressure effects on the indicated mean effective pressure (exhaust ORC) and friction mean effective pressure (coolant ORC). Nevertheless, these values serve as a reference point for the assessment of the current potential of a technology that is still being developed having major downfalls in the increase of weight, costs, packaging complexity and finally in difficulty in transient operation. ?? 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Increasing fuel efficiency of automobile engines has become a prime motive, as the fossil fuel reserves are limited. This has forced automakers to look into technologies that help utilising the available reserves effectively. A typical three cylinder engine at urban driving speed devours more fuel developing excess power than required. Fuel cutoff is a technique that minimises the excess fuel being burnt. The present work concentrates on performance characteristics obtained by integrating Scuderi Split Cycle concept with Spark Ignited (SI) engine that employs fuel cutoff technology. In the current numerical investigation, performance characteristics of a three cylinder SI engine (used in Volkswagen Polo car) was estimated by extrapolating the results obtained for single cylinder using commercially available Ricardo VECTIS tool. The simulation results are validated against analytical results ascertained in concern to engine working volume and compression ratio. The conceptual model that utilises the abandoned cylinder to supercharge the variable displacement engine is simulated to determine the enhancement in performance characteristics. The variable displacement SI engine of a small sized passenger car was found to reduce 33{\%} of fuel consumption and also satisfied the required road load condition for lower operating speeds. Implementation of the Scuderi split cycle concept in variable displacement SI engine supercharge the quality of intake air and improved the performance characteristics substantially by 5{\%} with the same amount of fuel supplied.},

The re-sizing of the propulsion systems according to the lighter vehicle weight to achieve the same acceleration as the basis vehicle is implemented as well.As an overall result it is established that no general value for the fuel consumption reduction per weight reduction exists. It is very important to consider all boundary conditions, especially the used driving cycle, the examined vehicle class, the type of propulsion system and a possible powertrain re-sizing. In detail the results show values between 2 and 8 {\%} fuel consumption reduction at a 10 {\%} weight reduction. Conventional powertrains fall in a range of 2 to 6 {\%} fuel consumption reduction for all driving cycles and vehicle classes. A strong impact of the powertrain re-sizing on the fuel consumption reduction is detected for the conventional powertrains, especially in the NEDC driving cycle. For the alternative powertrains the re-sizing has less impact.},

@article{Horst2014,
abstract = {Waste heat recovery (WHR) by means of a Rankine Cycle is a promising approach for achieving reductions in fuel consumption and, as a result, exhaust emissions of passenger car engines. To find the best compromise between complexity and fuel saving potential, methods for predicting the WHR performance for different system configurations and stationary as well as dynamic driving scenarios are needed. Since WHR systems are usually not included in today's car concepts, they are mostly designed as add-on systems. As a result their integration may lead to negative interactions due to increased vehicle weight, engine backpressure and cooling demand. These effects have to be considered when evaluating the fuel saving potential. A new approach for predicting WHR performance and fuel saving potential was developed and is presented in this paper. It is based on simple dynamic models of a system for recovering exhaust gas waste heat and its interfaces with the vehicle: the exhaust system for heat input, the on-board electric system for power delivery and the engine cooling system for heat rejection. The models are validated with test bench measurements of the cycle components. A study of fuel saving potential in an exemplary dynamic motorway driving scenario shows the effect of vehicle integration: while the WHR system could improve fuel economy by 3.4{\%}, restrictions in power output due to the architecture of the on-board electric system, package considerations, increased weight, cooling demand and exhaust gas backpressure lead to a reduction of fuel saving potential by 60{\%} to 1.3{\%}. A parameter study reveals that, in addition to weight reduction and efficiency optimization, combining the WHR system with enhanced electrification of engine peripherals is the most effective approach to improve fuel saving potential. When assuming an increase in power demand of the on-board electric system from 750 to 1500 W, a fuel saving potential of 4{\%} - referring to a 3.6{\%} higher reference fuel consumption - is reached. WHR could therefore play an important role to overcome the challenges of increased electric power demand in future vehicles. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The development and the design of the engine are based on 0D/1D model and experimental results have been compared with the engine model. The 5-stroke engine is a three-cylinder in which two cylinders perform a four-stroke cycle and alternatively a second expansion of the burnt gases is performed in the third cylinder. The boost pressure delivered by the turbocharger is controlled by a particular innovative system called "smart wastegate", different from a conventional wastegate, consisting in a variable valve timing of the two exhaust valves of the low pressure cylinder. The engine develops up to 40 kW for a speed range of 3500-4500 rpm. BSFC is 226 g/kW.h which corresponds to a fuel conversion efficiency of 36.1{\%}. This efficiency can be achieved for an engine speed of 4000 rpm and a brake power of 32.5 kW, which are notable scores for an MPI two-valve per cylinder engine. Expected optimum should be below 217 g/kW.h BSFC and over 90 N.m torque.

Driven by upcoming CO2 emission targets and increasing fuel costs, engine exhaust gas heat utilization has recently attracted much attention to improve fuel efficiency, especially for heavy-duty automotive applications. In this study, we focus on a Euro-VI heavy-duty diesel engine, which is equipped with a Waste Heat Recovery system based on an Organic Rankine Cycle. The applied model, which combines first principle modelling with stationary component models, covers the two-phase flow behavior and the effect of control inputs. Furthermore, it describes the interaction with the engine on both gas and drivetrain side. Using engine dynamometer measurements, an optimal fit of unknown model parameters is determined for stationary operating points. From model validation, it is concluded that the identified model shows good accuracy in steady-state and can reasonably capture the most important dynamics over a wide range of operating conditions.

abstract = {A novel concept for a high efficiency reciprocating internal combustion engine (the isoengine) is described and its cycle is analysed. The highly turbocharged engine configuration, which is intended primarily for on-site and distributed power generation, has a predicted electrical output of 7.3 MW. It has the option for co-generation of up to 3.2 MW of hot water at 95??C supply temperature. The maximum net electrical plant efficiency is predicted to be about 60{\%} on diesel fuel and 58{\%} on natural gas. The key to the high electrical efficiency is the quasi-isothermal compression of the combustion air in cylinders, which are separate from the power cylinders. This achieves a significant saving in compression work and allows the recovery of waste heat back into the cycle, mainly from the exhaust gas by means of a recuperator. The construction of a first 3 MWe prototype isoengine has been completed and its testing has begun. Relevant test results are expected in the near future. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In a modern internal combustion engine, most of the fuel energy is dissipated as heat, mainly in the form of hot exhaust gas. A high temperature is required to allow conversion of the engine-out emissions in the catalytic system, but the temperature is usually still high downstream of the exhaust gas aftertreatment system. One way to recover some of this residual heat is to implement a Rankine cycle, which is connected to the exhaust system via a heat exchanger. The relatively low weight increase due to the additional components does not cause a significant fuel penalty, particularly for heavy-duty vehicles.The efficiency of a waste-heat recovery system such as a Rankine cycle depends on the efficiencies of the individual components and the choice of a suitable working fluid for the given boundary conditions. Commonly used pure working fluids have the drawback of an isothermal evaporation and condensation, which increases irreversibility, and consequently decreases the efficiency during the heat transfer. Previous work has suggested that one way to overcome this problem is to use zeotropic mixed working fluids. These have already been applied in several stationary systems and refrigerant cycles but not yet in waste-heat recovery systems for portable applications.This theoretical study compares different pure working fluids and zeotropic mixtures in both subcritical and supercritical Rankine cycles. The main objective was to analyze the respective energy and exergy efficiencies by modeling the Rankine cycles. The results suggested that the final fluid and cycle choice is limited by the exhaust-gas temperature range of a heavy-duty diesel engine and realistic condensation conditions for the fluid. Further, environmental and safety concerns over working fluids in portable applications are important challenges, which need to be taken into account in selecting an appropriate fluid.},

abstract = {A concept adding two strokes to the Otto or Diesel engine cycle to increase fuel efficiency is presented here. It can be thought of as a four-stroke Otto or Diesel cycle followed by a two-stroke heat recovery steam cycle. A partial exhaust event coupled with water injection adds an additional power stroke. Waste heat from two sources is effectively converted into usable work: engine coolant and exhaust gas. An ideal thermodynamics model of the exhaust gas compression, water injection and expansion was used to investigate this modification. By changing the exhaust valve closing timing during the exhaust stroke, the optimum amount of exhaust can be recompressed, maximizing the net mean effective pressure of the steam expansion stroke (MEPsteam). The valve closing timing for maximum MEPsteam is limited by either 1 bar or the dew point temperature of the expansion gas/moisture mixture when the exhaust valve opens. The range of MEPsteam calculated for the geometry of a conventional gasoline engine and is from 0.75 to 2.5 bars. Typical combustion mean effective pressures (MEPcombustion) of naturally aspirated gasoline engines are up to 10 bar, thus this concept has the potential to significantly increase the engine efficiency and fuel economy. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This paper surveys the publications available in the literature concerning the application of the second-law of thermodynamics to internal combustion engines. The availability (exergy) balance equations of the engine cylinder and subsystems are reviewed in detail providing also relations concerning the definition of state properties, chemical availability, flow and fuel availability, and dead state. Special attention is given to identification and quantification of second-law efficiencies and the irreversibilities of various processes and subsystems. The latter being particularly important since they are not identified in traditional first-law analysis. In identifying these processes and subsystems, the main differences between second- and first-law analyses are also highlighted. A detailed reference is made to the findings of various researchers in the field over the last 40 years concerning all types of internal combustion engines, i.e. spark ignition, compression ignition (direct or indirect injection), turbocharged or naturally aspirated, during steady-state and transient operation. All of the subsystems (compressor, aftercooler, inlet manifold, cylinder, exhaust manifold, turbine), are also covered. Explicit comparative diagrams, as well as tabulation of typical energy and exergy balances, are presented. The survey extends to the various parametric studies conducted, including among other aspects the very interesting cases of low heat rejection engines, the use of alternative fuels and transient operation. Thus, the main differences between the results of second- and first-law analyses are highlighted and discussed. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Small scale Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) systems has been the object of a large number of studies in the last decade, because of their suitability for energy recovery and cogenerative applications. The paper presents an ORC numerical model and its applications to two different case studies; the code has been obtained by combining a one-dimensional model of a scroll machine and a thermodynamic model of a whole ORC system. Series production components, such as scroll compressors, from HVAC field, have been first considered in order to reduce costs, because this is a critical issue for small scale energy recovery and cogeneration systems. The detailed model of the scroll machine is capable to calculate the performances of both a compressor and an expander, as function of the geometry of the device and of the working fluid. The model has been first tested and validated by comparing its outputs with experimental tests on a commercial scroll compressor, then used to calculate the working curves of commercial scroll machines originally designed as compressors in the HVAC field, but operating as expanders. The model of the expander has been then integrated in the thermodynamic model of the ORC system. A series of comparisons have been carried out in order to evaluate how the performances are influenced by cycle parameters, scroll geometry and working fluid for different applications. The results confirm the feasibility of small scale CHP systems with acceptable electrical efficiency, taking into account the low-temperature thermal source, the small power output and the low-cost series production components employed. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Lam2015,
abstract = {Internal combustion engine (ICE) fuel efficiency is a balance between good indicated efficiency and mechanical efficiency. High indicated efficiency is reached with a very diluted air/fuel-mixture and high load resulting in high peak cylinder pressure (PCP). On the other hand, high mechanical efficiency is obtained with very low peak cylinder pressure as the piston rings and bearings can be made with less friction. This paper presents studies of a combustion engine which consists of a two stage compression and expansion cycle. By splitting the engine into two different cycles, high-pressure (HP) and low-pressure (LP) cycles respectively, it is possible to reach high levels of both indicated and mechanical efficiency simultaneously. The HP cycle is designed similar to today's turbo-charged diesel engine but with an even higher boost pressure, resulting in high PCP. To cope with high PCP, the engine needs to be rigid. The usage of higher piston ring tension and larger bearings are examples of measures to cope with higher PCP. These measures will cost in terms of friction. Hence, mechanical efficiency is not as good as other engine concepts with lower PCP. The low-pressure cycle on the other hand, uses a design more similar to current naturally aspirated (NA) spark ignited (SI) engines, but designed for even lower PCP. Because of this, the engine does not need to be as rigidly designed and the overall friction levels will be much lower. By combining these two engine philosophies, a total engine concept with both high indicated and mechanical efficiencies can be achieved. Simulations show net indicated efficiency above 60{\%} and a brake efficiency of 56{\%}.},

@article{Paanu2012,
abstract = {Based on its high efficiency, the diesel engine is the leading power source for several heavy-duty applications, such as marine installations, electricity production, on-road trucks and buses, and various off-road machines. Inherently, the high efficiency means low carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Still today, one of the global challenges over the whole energy field is to further reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change, including the reduction of the CO2 emissions. This can be achieved by increasing the energy efficiency and energy savings, and by finding renewable options instead of conventional fossil energy sources. In this respect, the diesel engine provides a good starting point with a potential to achieve substantial improvements both in energy efficiency and emissions reduction. (FCEP 2010) Within the ongoing large Finnish research program Future Combustion Engine Power Plant (FCEP), one of the work packages concentrates on the energy efficiency of internal combustion engines. Technologies related to the improvement of energy efficiency are developed. The engine itself, waste heat recovery (WHR) systems, or power conversion are investigated. This study was part of the FCEP research program and focused particularly on the waste heat recovery systems with a target to find feasible solutions to increase the electricity production of diesel and gas engine driven power plants. At the same time, energy efficiency is improved, decreasing CO2 emissions. Diesel engines, due to their high combustion temperature and pressure, provide an energy conversion technology that is more efficient than any other thermal power device. Especially within the medium-speed range, large diesel and gas engines can reach electrical efficiencies of more than 45{\%}. Nevertheless, the environmental concerns and increasing fuel prices push for continuous improvement in the energy efficiency. The WHR systems are seen as one of the most promising technologies to improve the efficiency of current diesel and gas engine installations significantly. The aim of this study was to search for and find thermodynamic processes and power conversion methods which could be applied as a WHR system in combination with diesel and gas engines to produce additional electrical power from the excess heat. Below, these processes and methods are briefly described and their practical potential is discussed. The study is mainly based on literature data collected in the University of Vaasa.},

abstract = {A novel intra-cycle waste heat recovery (ICWHR) methodology, applied to an internal combustion engine is presented in this study. Through a split type thermodynamic cycle design, quasi-isothermal compres- sion of the charge air and isobaric combustion of the air/fuel mixture can be performed separately in two chambers. Within such a design, the exhaust heat can be recovered to the intake air flow between the compression chamber and combustion chamber. Consequently, the recovered energy can be re-utilized in the combustor directly, and an intra-cycle waste heat recovery process can be achieved. To investigate the fundamental aspects of this new methodology, a comparative study between the conventional Rankine based WHR and the new ICWHR was undertaken. Both theoretical and numerical analysis were applied to evaluate the performance characteristics of these two technologies. The ICWHR cycle differs from the Rankine cycle in that an energy conversion subsystem is not necessary since the recovered energy is sent back to the combustion chamber directly, and then the system efficiency is improved sig- nificantly. Furthermore, the theoretical results indicate that the full cycle efficiency of ICWHR system is determined by the regeneration effectiveness, the compression ratio and the fuel equivalence ratio, then the limitations of Rankine cycle, such as working fluid selection and system parameter calibration can be avoided mechanically. Finally, through a one dimensional system model, analysis of optimal operation range, system efficiency and the heat transfer behaviours of ICWHR system are discussed in this paper and comparisons made with a Rankine cycle WHR system. ?2016},

This strategy is used as a benchmark for fuel consumption evaluation to assess the Charge Depleting-Charge Sustaining (CDCS) paradigm used today on-board of the vehicle. Moreover, a comparison of the powertrain modes of operation under the optimal and CDCS scenarios is conducted which shows a significant different use of the powertrain in the two cases.

abstract = {In the context of heat recovery for electric power generation, Kalina cycle (a thermodynamic cycle using as working fluid a mixture of water and ammonia) and Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) represent two different eligible technologies. In this work a comparison between the thermodynamic performances of Kalina cycle and an ORC cycle, using hexamethyldisiloxane as working fluid, was conducted for the case of heat recovery from two Diesel engines, each one with an electrical power of 8900 kWe. The maximum net electric power that can be produced exploiting the heat source constituted by the exhaust gases mass flow (35 kg/s for both engines, at 346 ??C) was calculated for the two thermodynamic cycles. Owing to the relatively low useful power, for the Kalina cycle a relatively simple plant layout was assumed. Supposing reasonable design parameters and a logarithmic mean temperature difference in the heat recovery exchanger of 50 ??C, a net electric power of 1615 kW and of 1603 kW respectively for the Kalina and for the ORC cycle was calculated. Although the obtained useful powers are actually equal in value, the Kalina cycle requires a very high maximum pressure in order to obtain high thermodynamic performances (in our case, 100 bar against about 10 bar for the ORC cycle). So, the adoption of Kalina cycle, at least for low power level and medium-high temperature thermal sources, seems not to be justified because the gain in performance with respect to a properly optimized ORC is very small and must be obtained with a complicated plant scheme, large surface heat exchangers and particular high pressure resistant and no-corrosion materials. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Study on recovering waste heat of engine exhaust gas using organic Rankine cycle (ORC) has continuously increased in recent years. However, it is difficult to find out appropriate working fluids to match with exhaust gas waste heat due to high temperature. In this work, several tentative attempts and explorations are made in selecting Alkanes as working fluid owing to their excellent thermo-physical and environmental characteristics. Parameters optimization of the combined system of diesel engine with bottoming ORC (DE-ORC) is performed on Alkane-based working fluids with six indicators, including thermal efficiency (??), exergy destruction factor (EDF), turbine size parameter (SP), total exergy destruction rate (IORC), turbine volume flow ratio (VFR) and net power output per unit mass flow rate of exhaust (Pnet). Afterwards, the impact of molecular complexity on the indicators of VFR and SP is analyzed. Furthermore, the energy distribution of engine exhaust gases and the improvement of fuel economy, after integrating the bottoming ORC with diesel engine, are also discussed. Finally, the performance comparison between Cyclohexane-based ORCandsteam cycle with relative pressure is carriedout. The results show that optimized working fluids are not always constant subject to different indicators and operation parameters. However, cyclic Alkanes, Cyclohexane and Cyclopentane are considered as the most suitable working fluids when taking into account of all comprehensive indicators. The maximum improvement of 10{\%} in brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) is obtained for DE-ORC combined systems with Cyclohexane used as working fluid. In addition, although steamhasmoreadvantagesin thermal efficiency in the current conditions, from a technical and economic point of view, Alkane-based ORCs may be more attractive than conventional steam cycles, specifically for DE waste gas heat recovery. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},
