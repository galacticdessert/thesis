@article{Wang2013,
abstract = {While EER (Exhaust Energy Recovery) has been widely pursued for improving the total efficiency and reducing CO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} emissions of internal combustion engines, the improvement on engine efficiency has been investigated with experimental work and numerical simulation based on a steam Rankine cycle EER system. The test was conducted on a light-duty gasoline engine connected with a multi-coil helical heat exchanger. Combining those experimental and modelling results, it demonstrates that the flow rate of working fluid plays a very important and complex role for controlling the steam outlet pressure and overheat degree. For achieving required overheat and steam pressure, the flow rate must be carefully regulated if the engine working condition changes. The flow rate has also significant influence on the heat exchanger efficiency. To achieving better heat transfer efficiency, the flow rate should be maintained as high as possible. From the simulation, it is found the EER system based on the light-duty test engine could increase the engine fuel conversion efficiency up to 14{\%}, though under general vehicle operating conditions it was just between 3{\%} and 8{\%}. From the test, it is found the installation of heat exchanger can increase the exhaust back pressure slightly, the total fuel saving of the engine could be up to 34{\%} under some operating condition.},

@article{Conklin2010,
abstract = {A concept adding two strokes to the Otto or Diesel engine cycle to increase fuel efficiency is presented here. It can be thought of as a four-stroke Otto or Diesel cycle followed by a two-stroke heat recovery steam cycle. A partial exhaust event coupled with water injection adds an additional power stroke. Waste heat from two sources is effectively converted into usable work: engine coolant and exhaust gas. An ideal thermodynamics model of the exhaust gas compression, water injection and expansion was used to investigate this modification. By changing the exhaust valve closing timing during the exhaust stroke, the optimum amount of exhaust can be recompressed, maximizing the net mean effective pressure of the steam expansion stroke (MEPsteam). The valve closing timing for maximum MEPsteam is limited by either 1 bar or the dew point temperature of the expansion gas/moisture mixture when the exhaust valve opens. The range of MEPsteam calculated for the geometry of a conventional gasoline engine and is from 0.75 to 2.5 bars. Typical combustion mean effective pressures (MEPcombustion) of naturally aspirated gasoline engines are up to 10 bar, thus this concept has the potential to significantly increase the engine efficiency and fuel economy. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the life cycle GHG emissions from wind and hydro power generation, based on relevant published studies. Comparisons with conventional fossil, nuclear and other renewable generation systems are also presented, in order to put the GHG emissions of wind and hydro power in perspective. Studies on GHG emissions from wind and hydro power show large variations in GHG emissions, varying from 0.2 to 152 g CO 2-equivalents per kW h. The main parameters affecting GHG emissions are also discussed in this article, in relation to these variations. The wide ranging results indicate a need for stricter standardised rules and requirements for life-cycle assessments (LCAs), in order to differentiate between variations due to methodological disparities and those due to real differences in performance of the plants. Since LCAs are resource- and time-intensive, development of generic GHG results for each technology could be an alternative to developing specific data for each plant. This would require the definition of typical parameters for each technology, for example a typical capacity factor for wind power. Such generic data would be useful in documenting GHG emissions from electricity generation for electricity trading purposes. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.},

@article{Unger2010,
abstract = {A much-cited bar chart provided by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change displays the climate impact, as expressed by radiative forcing in watts per meter squared, of individual chemical species. The organization of the chart reflects the history of atmospheric chemistry, in which investigators typically focused on a single species of interest. However, changes in pollutant emissions and concentrations are a symptom, not a cause, of the primary driver of anthropogenic climate change: human activity. In this paper, we suggest organizing the bar chart according to drivers of change-that is, by economic sector. Climate impacts of tropospheric ozone, fine aerosols, aerosol-cloud interactions, methane, and long-lived greenhouse gases are considered. We quantify the future evolution of the total radiative forcing due to perpetual constant year 2000 emissions by sector, most relevant for the development of climate policy now, and focus on two specific time points, near-term at 2020 and long-term at 2100. Because sector profiles differ greatly, this approach fosters the development of smart climate policy and is useful to identify effective opportunities for rapid mitigation of anthropogenic radiative forcing.},
